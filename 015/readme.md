# Python Password Generator - High Entropy

A simple password generator written in Python. The program generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria.
It uses the `secrets` module to generate cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, and security tokens.

## What I learned

- Generate secure passwords using randomization.
- Use libraries such as `random` and `string` for password generation.
- Concatenate the pool of rules to create a password.


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/epcgrs/100daysofcode.git
    cd 100daysOfCode/015
    ```
2. **Run Python Server**

    ```bash
    python3 secure_password_generator.py
    ```

3. **Interact with CLI** to generate a password.
