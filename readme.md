# 100 days of code

this is a 100-day code project, a challenge where I will publish 100 mini projects.

The goal is to keep active and solve simple problems as best as possible by learning new technologies and things in the course of that time.

## Attention

⚠️ The focus of this project is to learn and practice, not to create a production-ready application. The code may contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.
