# 100 days of code

this is a 100-day code project, a challenge where I will publish 100 mini projects. 

The goal is to keep active and solve simple problems as best as possible by learning new technologies and things in the course of that time.

## Projects

1. [Stoic quotes](https://github.com/epcgrs/100daysofcode/tree/main/1): a simple web app that shows a random stoic quote every time you refresh the page. It uses a sqlite3 database for storage, an API in PHP, and JS for the front end to get the quotes from API.
