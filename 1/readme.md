# Stoic Quotes

### This is a simple web app that shows a random stoic quote every time you refresh the page. It uses a sqlite3 database for storage, an API in PHP, and JS for the front end to get the quotes from API.

### The project is divided into two parts: the API and the front end.
### The API is a simple PHP script that connects to a sqlite3 database and returns a random quote in JSON format. The front end is a simple HTML page with a button that fetches the quote from the API and displays it on the page.
