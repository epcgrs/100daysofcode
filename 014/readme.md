# Python Password Generator - Low Entropy

A simple password generator written in Python. The program generates low entropy passwords based on user-defined criteria.

## What I learned
- How to use Python to create a password generator.
- Implement user input for password criteria.
- Generate insecure passwords using randomization.
- Use libraries such as `random` (insecure for password generation) and `string` for password generation.
- Concatenate the pool of rules to create a password.

- See `100daysOfCode/015/secure_password_generator.py` for a more secure password generator.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

    cd 100daysOfCode/014
    ```
2. **Run Python Server**

    ```bash
    python3 password_generator.py
    ```

3. **Interact with CLI** to generate a password.
